cd into the project directory and install the dependencies:
```bash
cd my-app-name
npm install
```

Make sure your python environment has all required packages. A virtural environment is recommended.

```bash
python3 -m venv my-environment
source my-environment/bin/activate
```

Finally, start the development server:
```bash
